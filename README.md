You can do anything with the source code (besides sell it) as long as you give proper credit to the right people. 
If you are going to make a mod of this version, be sure to give credit to Markus "Notch" Perrson because he did create the original game after all.

This source code is subject to a lot of change for better optimization/cleanliness.
